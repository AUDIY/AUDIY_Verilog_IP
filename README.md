# AUDIY_Verilog_IP
Verilog IP that AUDIY originally designed.

Code reviews are welcome!

## Notice: This repository is no longer maintained.
The author made a decision to shift HDL from Verilog to SystemVerilog.  
So it means that the author doesn't maintain and use modules in this repository.

The new IP repository written in SystemVerilog is [AUDIY_SV_IP](https://github.com/AUDIY/AUDIY_SV_IP)

Thanks.
